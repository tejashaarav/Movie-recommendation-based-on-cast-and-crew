The fast expansion of data collecting has ushered in a new era of data. Recommendation Systems are used to produce more efficient systems using data. Recommendation Systems are a sort of information filtering system that improves the quality of search results by presenting things that are more relevant to the search item or to the user's search history.

They are used to anticipate a user's rating or preference for a certain item. Almost every big IT business has implemented them in some way. In this project we use demographic filtering
This recommender proposes related goods depending on the content of a certain item. For movies, our system makes suggestions based on metadata such as genre, director, description, actors, and so on. The basic premise underlying these recommender systems is that if a person likes one item, he or she will also enjoy another similar.
